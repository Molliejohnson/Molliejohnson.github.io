  <h2> Step 1</h2>
  Gather all needed materials

  <h2> Step 2</h2>
  Carefully attach vibrating motor to the underside of the solar panel with a hot glue gun. Glue Dots may be a better adhesive option for younger children. If the vibrating motor has any spinning parts attach it to the back end of the solar panel and leave the spinning part off the solar panel.

  <h2> Step 3</h2>
  Attach wires from the vibrating motor to the corresponding colored wires on the solar panel.

  <h2> Step 4</h2>
  Bend jumbo paper clips to attach as legs. Measure the paper clips to one and a half inches and cut with scissors. The length of the paper clip may vary depending on the size of your solar panel. Make sure all paper clips are the same length.
