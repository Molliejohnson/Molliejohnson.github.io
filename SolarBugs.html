 <h2> Steps to make your own solar bug </h2>

 <h3>Step 1</h3>
  Gather all needed materials
</p>
<p>
  <h3> Step 2</h3>
  Carefully attach vibrating motor to the underside of the solar panel with a hot glue gun. 
  Glue Dots may be a better adhesive option for younger children. If the vibrating motor has any spinning parts attach it to the back end of the solar panel and leave the spinning part off the solar panel.
</p>
<p>
  <h3>Step 3</h3>
  Attach wires from the vibrating motor to the corresponding colored wires on the solar panel.

<p>
  <h3> Step 4</h3>
  Bend jumbo paper clips to attach as legs. Measure the paper clips to one and a half inches and cut with scissors. The length of the paper clip may vary depending on the size of your solar panel. Make sure all paper clips are the same length.
</p>
<p>
  <h3>Step 5</h3>
  Using the hot glue gun attach legs to the underside of the solar panel. Place three paper clip legs on each side of the solar panel body.
</p>
<p>
  <h3>Step 6</h3>
  Glue on wiggly eyes and antennas to the front side of the solar panel. Make sure the eyes and antennas are on the opposite end location of the vibrating motor if you have one.
</p>
<p>
  <h3>Step 7</h3>
  Cut out brown construction paper wings about three inches long or appropriate size for your solar panel. Glue on construction paper covers as wings to insure that your cockroach can be shut down during the day if you do not want to use it. The wings should fold back and forth over the solar panel and may be fastened down as necessary with a glue dot.
</p>
<p>
  <h3>Step 8</h3>
  Use creativity to decorate further if desired.
